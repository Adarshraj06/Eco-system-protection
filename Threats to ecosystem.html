            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Anything that seeks to change the equilibrium of an ecosystem has the potential to endanger its health and existence. Some of these dangers are not excessively concerning since they may be remedied organically if natural circumstances are restored. Other causes can devastate ecosystems, causing all or some of their living forms to become extinct.</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Economic operations such as logging, mining, farming, and building frequently include the removal of natural vegetative cover. Tampering with one aspect of an ecosystem may frequently have a cascading impact on many more or all other factors of that ecosystem. Clearing a portion of forest for lumber, for example, might expose the upper layers of soil to the sun’s heat, producing erosion and dryness. It has the potential to kill or relocate many animals and insects that rely on the shade and moisture provided by the tree. </p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The sun’s beams are vital to all living things. UV rays are classified into three wavelengths: UVA, UVB, and UVC, each with its own set of qualities. UVA has long wavelengths and constantly reaches the earth’s surface. It aids in the production of vitamin D for living organisms. UVB and UVC rays are more damaging, causing DNA and cell damage in plants and animals. Ozone depletion is one method of exposing living things to UVB and UVC radiation, and the consequences can wipe out many species and impact ecosystem members, including people. </p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Water, land, and air pollution all has a significant impact on ecosystem health. Pollution can be natural or produced by humans, but both have the potential to introduce harmful agents or chemicals (pollutants) into the habitats of living organisms. “In a lake, for example, it can disrupt the biological equilibrium by promoting plant growth and killing fish owing to asphyxia caused by a lack of oxygen.” The oxygen cycle will be disrupted, and the contaminated water will have an impact on the species that rely on lake water.” WWF studies the impact of pollution on the environment.</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Any foreign species (biological) that enters an ecosystem, whether by natural or human introduction, can have an impact on the ecosystem. If these aliens can feed on fragile and native members of the ecosystem, they will be killed sooner or later. The demise of over half of the 350+ native species of fish in the cichlid family was one of the disastrous effects of introducing alien Nile Perch and Nile Tilapia into Lake Victoria in the 1970s. </p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">This is the enrichment of water bodies with plant biomass caused by a constant input of nutrients, mainly nitrogen, and phosphorus. Water eutrophication promotes excessive plant and algae development while simultaneously harming aquatic life, resulting in a loss of flora and fauna variety. Blooms of blue-green algae contaminated drinking water sources, deterioration of recreational opportunities and hypoxia are all documented outcomes of cultural eutrophication. .</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Fish, wildlife, and particular flora all suffer from over-harvesting or human over-dependence on them from time to time. Overharvesting reduces populations, community structures, and dispersion, resulting in a decrease in total recruitment. Many fish species have achieved their maximum utilization level, and others will do so shortly. “For example, Oreochromis karongae is one of Malawi’s most important food fish, but numbers fell in the 1990s owing to overfishing, and it is now considered Endangered.” Major Threats, per the IUCN. </p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Many parts of our land are being over population by human population over population means more demands and less supply. This creates an imbalance and disturbs the ecosystem as the human survival, the shelter of birds and animals are getting destroyed. This also increases the fossil fuel consumption and the harmful impact of it on the in environment.</p>

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The major causes for this are the increased level of co2, and that is because of the increased rate of burning of fossil flues. Current measurements of co2 levels have exceeded above 400 ppm breaking every record dating back 400,000 years. And this has led to increase in earth’s temperature, which leads to melting of glaciers and increases in ocean level to rise.</p>
